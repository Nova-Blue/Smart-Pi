# Smart-Pi

Smart Pi is an Alexa skill developed in Python, and designed to run on my Raspberry Pi. Its main goal is to tie together some of my smaller projects and enhance them using the voice command functionality provided by Alexa. Namley, it can automatically navigate menus on a [Roku TV](https://github.com/Nova-Blue/RokuTV-Night-Day), turn on a network device, like a computer, using [Wake-on-LAN](https://github.com/Nova-Blue/Wake-on-LAN), or perform a [Remote Shutdown](https://github.com/Nova-Blue/Remote-Shutdown) of a Windows computer.
